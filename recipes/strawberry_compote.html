        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>Strawberry Compote is a chilled sweet drink that is popular in many post-soviet countries. </h3>
        <p>It is similar to strawberry jam or conserves in taste (less sweet/concentrated flavor), but resembles fruit punch in looks and consistency. It is very easy to adjust this recipe and scale it up/down</p>
        <p>FYI, I suggest using organic strawberries for this (may be on the expensive side), it makes a world of difference in flavor.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Strawberries (two standard packs works best)</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol> 
            <li>Get 3 bowls and a butter knife</li>
            <li>Dump out both packs of strawberries into a sieve or bowl and wash them thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Remove the stem and leaves/crown of the strawberry. The crown can be peeled by hand, then use the butter knife to cut out the stem.</li>
            <li>Large strawberries can be cut in half.</li>
            <li>Once all of the strawberries are clean, put them in a standard 4 quart (3.8 L) pot. Fill it with water to the brim.</li>
            <li>Put the pot to boil. The strawberries will gradually lose their color, which is completely normal.</li>
            <li>Once it boils, let it cook for 5 mins.</li>
            <li>After five minutes are over, turn off the heat and incrementally add sugar to your preference. I suggest 1-1.5 cups (237 to 355 grams) of sugar for 4 quarts (3.8 L) of compote. Taste between helpings of sugar to make sure its not oversweetened.</li>
            <li>Let the pot cool, then refrigerate. Serve chilled.</li>
        </ol>
