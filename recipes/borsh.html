        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>Borscht is a sour soup, made with meat stock, vegetables and seasonings, common in Eastern Europe.</h3>
        <p>In Kievan Rus, borscht was prepared from edible leaves of borscht — hence the name. Later, they began to cook with beets, and since the 19th century, potatoes have been added.</p>
        <p>Today, every family has its own recipe for borscht. Beans, mushrooms, smoked meats, and even celery are added to the pan. We will teach you how to cook the perfect traditional borscht.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (1 inch thick) slice bone-in beef shank</li>
            <li>3 quarts wate</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped carrots</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped celery</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>3 cups diced peeled beets</li>
            <li>2 cups chopped cabbage</li>
            <li>¼ cup white vinegar, or to taste</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup sour cream, for garnish</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol> 
            <li>Cook beef shank in a large soup pot over high heat until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Add water, onion, carrots, celery, and bay leaf; bring to a simmer and cook until meat is tender and falling off the bone, about 4 hours. Strain broth and discard solids.</li>
            <li>Combine beef broth, beets, and cabbage in the same pot; cook, stirring occasionally, until beets are tender, about 30 minutes. Reduce heat to low; add vinegar, salt, and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Serve soup in bowls garnished with sour cream and dill.</li>
        </ol>
